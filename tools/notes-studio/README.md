# Notes Studio

Local editor for `content/notes` (see #23). It runs on `127.0.0.1` only and is
not part of the site build: `tools/` is excluded from the site's TypeScript,
ESLint and Tailwind sources.

## Run

From the repo root, after the root `npm install`:

```sh
npm run studio:install   # once, installs this package's dependencies
npm run studio           # http://127.0.0.1:4310
```

Set `STUDIO_PORT` to use another port. Needs Node 22.18 or newer (the server
runs TypeScript directly).

## Layout

- `server/`: one Node process on one origin.
  - `index.ts` is the entry point; it checks the dependencies are installed.
  - `studio-server.ts` puts the pieces together: it binds the port and mounts
    Vite and the handlers below.
  - `config.ts` holds the host, the port and the root paths.
  - `routing.ts` runs the guard on every request and upgrade, then hands the
    request to a handler.
  - `http.ts` holds small HTTP helpers.
  - `security/` has the Host/Origin guard and the path policy.
  - `files/` has the file API, the file events and the file-system helpers.
  - `sync/` has the fumadocs-editor sync server for `content/notes`.
- `src/`: the React UI. `src/api/` holds the clients for the server.
- `tests/`: laid out like `server/` and `src/`. `tests/support/` holds the
  fixtures: a throwaway worktree, a Studio on a free port, and raw HTTP and
  websocket helpers.
- Shared code from the site is imported as `@site/...`, for example the notes
  frontmatter and `meta.yaml` schemas in `@site/lib/notes-schema`.

## Server

Everything the server touches goes through two checks.

- **Origin guard** (`server/guard.ts`). Every request and every websocket
  upgrade must carry `Host: 127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`, which
  stops DNS rebinding. If it sends `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site`, they must be
  this origin. Requests without them (curl, agents) pass on Host alone. A
  websocket upgrade that is neither Vite HMR nor the notes sync is closed.
- **Path policy** (`server/paths.ts`). Paths are relative to the worktree, in
  posix form. Only `content/notes/**/*.mdx`, `content/notes/**/meta.yaml` and
  assets under `public/notes/` (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, avif, svg, html,
  glb, pdf) are allowed. `..`, empty segments and hidden segments such as
  `.obsidian` are refused, and so is any symlink on the path, even one that
  points inside: a save replaces the file, so it would turn a linked note into
  a copy. The file API, the file events and the notes sync all use this check.

The worktree is this checkout for now; `startStudioServer({ root })` takes
another one.

| Endpoint | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/files` | Lists the editable files: `{ files: [{ path, kind, mtimeMs }] }` |
| `GET /api/file?path=…` | Notes and `meta.yaml` come back as `{ path, content, mtimeMs }`. Assets come back as bytes with an `X-Mtime` header. |
| `PUT /api/file?path=…` | Notes and `meta.yaml` take a JSON body `{ content, baseMtime }`. Assets take the raw bytes plus `X-Studio-Write: 1` and `X-Base-Mtime`. |
| `GET /api/events` | Server-sent events: `{ type: "add" \| "change" \| "unlink", path, mtimeMs }` |
| `/__fde_sync` (websocket) | The fumadocs-editor sync server for `content/notes`. It reads `.mdx` only, writes only notes that already exist (no page or folder creation; that goes through the file API), and merges changes made on disk into open documents. Known gap: its tree `delete` command still removes an existing note, without updating `meta.yaml` or checking the mtime, because the scope cannot tell it apart from a save on the same path. Don't wire the editor's tree delete until upstream can authorize tree commands separately (fuma-nama/fumadocs-editor#24). |

A save names the mtime it was edited from; `null` means a new file. If the
file changed on disk since then, for example in Obsidian or by an agent, the
server writes nothing. It answers `409` with the disk version
`{ content, mtimeMs }` (`null` if the file was deleted). Retry with that
`mtimeMs` to keep your version. Writes are atomic: the server writes a hidden
temp file and renames it over the target, keeping the file's mode.

`src/api/files.ts` is the UI client. `writeFile` throws a
`FileConflictError` that holds the disk version. `subscribeFileEvents` follows
`/api/events`.

## Checks

```sh
npm --prefix tools/notes-studio test
npm --prefix tools/notes-studio run lint   # strict typescript-eslint + React hooks
npm --prefix tools/notes-studio run types:check
```
